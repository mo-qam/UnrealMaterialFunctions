**Description:**  
The Tiling & Offset function allows for precise control over the repetition and positioning of textures within your material.The offset parameters enable you to shift the texture coordinates, providing an additional layer of customization. This function brings together both tiling and offset controls into a single, user-friendly interface, enhancing workflow efficiency and creative flexibility.
