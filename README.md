**Description:**  
NormalMultiplier enhances the impact of normal maps on your materials. This function allows you to amplify or dampen the normal intensity, providing extra control over how light interacts with your surfaces. Ideal for adding extra depth or subtlety to your textures.

**Description:**  
EmissiveFlicker adds dynamic lighting variations to your emissive materials. This function generates a flickering effect that can be adjusted for speed, intensity, and randomness. It's excellent for simulating unstable lights, glowing objects, or animated screen displays.
